## Installation

Windows:

1. Download the CapsuleWars.rar file from [releases](https://github.com/lucassene/CapsuleWars/releases).
2. Install it in your disk. You need *both* the .exe and .pck files.

## Hosting a game

1. Have your *external* IP in hands. You do not need to type it in the *IP* field.
2. If you want, you can change the default port (23571). Just type it in the *Port* Field in the lobby inside the game, otherwise, leave it blank.
3. If you connect to the internet through a router or modem you will need to port forward the desired port in your device's configuration. If you need any help, try this [website](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/general-port-forwarding-guide/).*
4. With the above steps out of the way, just hit the *Host* button.
5. Give your *external* IP to the people you want to play with and wait them to join.
6. After everyone has already joined, hit the *Begin* button.
> *The port issue can be overcome by having a dedicated server or using services such as [Steamworks](https://partner.steamgames.com/).

## Joining a game

1. Have the external IP of the person which will be hosting
2. Type the IP in the *IP* field in the lobby inside the game.
3. If the host changed the default port, type it in the *Port field*, ortherwise, leave it blank.
